your_company
============

## Foreword
This project hasn't been actively developed for quite some time. We're not sure if development on this project will actually continue. If you would like to take over this repository, then please tell us in the issues for this repo!

"your_company" is a boilerplate for magento theme development. Founded on the base magento theme (1.7.0.2 to be exact), we completely restructured the entire theme to use the Skeleton CSS Framework. Your magento theme will look good on just about any device imaginable.

### Who should use this
This starter template is right for anyone who has knowledge of HTML, CSS, and basic PHP skills. The default look of the theme is intentionally minimalistic and only containes the necessary structural code to make magento function with the default features. The extra images and code has been removed for your design pleasure.

### Let me Contribute!
